We have set up an Election Booth with client-side and two servers, CTF and CLA.
In the Election Booth the voter can vote for their favorite Cartoon. 

The setup with one CTF and one CLA is two prevent cheating. The voter first 
have to write her UserID and Password. This is sent and verified in the CLA. 
The CLA then answers with a random ValidationsID two the client, the client
then automatically sends this to the CTF, the CTF also receives the validationID
directly from the CLA. The CTF then compares the validationID it received from 
the CLA and the client. If these are the same, the voter can vote. 

All connections are setup with a TLS-connection to encrypt all the data between
servers and clients. This is so that the data cannot be manipulated or intercepted.

Keystores and Truststores are used for keys, this is so that only authorized servers
or clients can connect to the sockets.
